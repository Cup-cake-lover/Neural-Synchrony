# Manim Code for Visualizing phase synchrony 

This project visualizes the Kuramoto model of coupled oscillators using the Manim library. The Kuramoto model is a mathematical model used to describe synchronization in a system of coupled oscillators. This visualization helps to understand the dynamics of such a system.


to run the code run (please make sure manim is properly installed)
manim -pql kuramoto_oscillators.py KuramotoOscillators

Example animations along with some other animations used can be found in /animations_examples
